                                        <h2>Gear Reducer Box Design</h2>
                                    </header>
                            
                                    <p>
                                        The Fall quarter of 2018, from September to December, I took a tribology (the study of gears) and bearing design course.
                                        The final project required me to design a full gear reducer system complete with three shafts, each with gears and bearings.
                                        The prompt for the project is shown in the first image on the right. It specified the imput power and the reduction in power
                                        required at each shaft. The radius, teeth number, and locking mechanism of the gears were all determined using extensive
                                        calculations based on this prompt. Then, the gears were designed and assembled using NX. Next, the shapts were made to fit
                                        the gears with a locking mechanism and have a large enough diameter to withstand the input torque. One of the shafts is shown
                                        in the second image on the left. Finally, the bearings were designed as angle rolling bearings for the ends of each shaft.
                                        Assemblies were created for each of the three shafts, and drawings were made of these assemblies. One of these drawings is
                                        shown in the image below.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This project taught me valuable skills in gear and bearing design based on given values or collected data, something that
                                        can be very useful in drive train design and other geared mechanisms.
