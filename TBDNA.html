                                    <p>
                                        I spent my second quarter of senior design in South Africa from January to March of 2020. There, I spent time learning
                                        about the culture, history, and healthcare system of the country as well as completeing a design project in the Biomedical
                                        Engineering field. One partner and I were tasked with improving the method used by the Tygerberg Genomics Research Group for
                                        for separating DNA and RNA from Tuberculosis cells. The central goal was to make the process faster while maintaining a similarly
                                        high yeild of DNA from cells because the lab needed to complete this process everyday and improved effiecny would allow them
                                        to complete more research and help more patients.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Tygerberg Genomics Research Group is a laboratory group at Stellenbosch University's Tygerberg medical campus in Cape Town,
                                        South Africa. Along with separating DNA, this group takes sputum samples from patients with Tuberculosis, cultures it to grow
                                        the bacteria cells, separates the DNA, and sends it to a lab in the US thst performs Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). WGS can
                                        help researches better understand the disease and develop drugs to treat it, a very important measure for a country with such
                                        wide spread TB.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We set about learning the current method of DNA extraction by performing one in their lab space. It took a little less than
                                        two and a half days to complete the extraction, with plenty of waiting time ni between. We were about to target the part of
                                        the process after the cells have been lysed (broken open) when the DNA is actually being removed from the rest of the debris
                                        as a key time to increase efficiency. Through research, we realized that the negatively charged phosphate backbone of a DNA
                                        or RNA strand is one of the few negatively charged parts of a lysed cell. By using a positively charged electrode, we could
                                        extract only the DNA from the cell debris and then reverse the polarity to expell it into a separate fluid. This would reduce
                                        the number necessary added chemicals by half making it more affordable and more simple and make the process 10% faster.
                                    </p>

                                        In terms of design, the quarter only afforded us the time to identify a way to increase efficiency and do some design work
                                        before we passed the project on to a local Master's student. After some further user observation we determined that desiging
                                        electrode in the shape of micro pipette, something the lab technicians were very familiar with using. Furthermore, we worked
                                        with a robptics research group to design the electrode to have a gold body with a nafion coating to ensure it is both highly
                                        conductive and inert so as to keep the DNA and highly unstable RNA intact. The two buttons shown on the design are intended to
                                        be for both DNA collection and release respectively. They are located in the same place are the collection button on a micro
                                        pipette. We hope our deisgn with be built, tested, and implemented as soon as possible.
