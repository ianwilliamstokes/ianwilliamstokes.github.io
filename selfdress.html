                                        <h2>Self-Dressing Device</h2>
                                    </header>
                            
                                    <p>
                                        In the Winter of 2017, I completed by second quarter of Design Thinking and Communication (DTC) from January to March.
                                        I was elected as the chief client communicator by our team following my strong performance the previosu quarter in that
                                        area. The project for this course was to design a device to assist a patient with bilateral shoulder amputation in putting
                                        on and taking off his pants with out the help of another person. The process and deliverables were much the same as the
                                        first quarter of DTC.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Bilateral shoulder amputation means that our patient had both his arms amputated at the shoulder, so he did not have the
                                        use of either his hands or arms when getting dressed. This was one of the few things he wanted to be able to accomplish
                                        on his own, so our team was asked to asssit him in his goal. Through a lengthy user centered design process or background
                                        research, user observation, brainstorming, concept generation, prototyping, user and performance testing, and prototype
                                        iteration, our team developed the 'Dressing Tree' design shown in the first image on the right. The full deivce was a peg board with several components that can be moved around to suit the user's needs and comfort. 
                                        It had a 'nudging' component with black rubber to help the user pull up and push down pants, shown in the center of the peg board and in the image below.
                                        Two hooks facing towards eachother horizonatally on the right side of the peg board served to bring his button and button
                                        hole together laterally, so they could be fastened. A button extender was also used on the pants to assist in this. Two hooks facing
                                        away from eachother vertically on the left side were used to pull up of down the fly of the pants respectively. As shown
                                        in the second image on the right, the device was suspended from the inside of a door. The height was adjustable for the
                                        user's comfort and to be used on different door sizes. It was also design to be portable, so the user could travel with it
                                        and set it up in any bathroom.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The effort of our work paid off well since the user was able to put on and take off his pants without outside assistance.
                                        He still uses the device for dressing today, and it is the only device on the market with such capabilities. This design
                                        process was considerably more difficult than my first quarter in DTC since their was no existing products or research to
                                        base our design on. Despite this fact, our worked turned out to be a great success and benefitted our user's life.
