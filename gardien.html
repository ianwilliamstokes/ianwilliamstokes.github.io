                                        <h2>Rolling Gardening Seat</h2>
                                    </header>
                            
                                    <p>
                                        For my first quarter of senior design, from September to December 2020, I worked on a team to design an rolling
                                        gardening seat for a local gerdening tools designer and manufacturer, Gardien, a subsidiary of Consolidated Foam.
                                        The project was given to us by the company with the expectation of a our team delivering a product to be taken to
                                        market at the end of the course. For background research, we conducted hundreds of user interviews with gardeners,
                                        gardening shop owners, gardening instructors, landscape companies, online gardening forums, Chicago Botanic Garden,
                                        and more. Using this data along with benchmarked and competitor products we began to develop design needs and requirements
                                        for the project and evertually several design concepts.We created two rounds of prototypes based on about 100 initial design concepts. The first was a way for us to see what
                                        manufacturing methods, materials, and mechanisms worked well for a gardening seat. The next was a way for us to refine and
                                        improve on the first designs after several rounds of user testing. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Each round of prototypes had four designs. I designed and built one of those four for each round. For the first, I focused on user's needs to both sit and kneel while gardening,
                                        to be both close to their work and comfortable. Product storage and tool trandportation and storage were both also
                                        improtant to the design. The CAD for the first prototype and a mock up build of it are shwon in the first three pictures
                                        on the right. The cart can be wheeled around like a wagon for simple transportation. The top is a cusioned seat, of which the
                                        height can be adjusted. The seast flips open to the side creating a space for tools under it. The user can then kneel in the
                                        area between the adjustable seat posts. These posts can be used to assist the user in getting in and out of the kneeling position.
                                        The cart in kneeling mode can be seen in the second picture on the right.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After testing the cart with users, it was determined that it did not appear or feel structuraly sound enough espetially for
                                        older users. Additionally, it was too heavy for the same user group. I created and bult a second prototype after a similar
                                        process of concept creation and needs and requirements edits. This second design focused more on structure, portability,
                                        storage, and weight. This second prototype is shwon in the last two images on the right and the image below. The device
                                        is similar to a stroller of walker and can bee folded up, as shown in the last image on the right, for easy storage. The
                                        user can push it to their desired gardening pocation with tools on the seat or in a tool storage bag that was later added.
                                        Then the user can sit on the black fabric area as a seat and use their feet to move forward and back while gardening. Additional
                                        supports were added to the design after these pictures and the wood braces were replaced with metal in a future iteration.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Overall, the team decided to move forward with a different final concept to be presented to GArdien based on futher user testing.
                                        This process, however, gave me tangible skills in user centered design for a company in the professional world, something I am
                                        looking to build on in future work.
                                    </p>
