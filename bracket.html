                                        <h2>Design for Failure Bracket</h2>
                                    </header>
                            
                                    <p>
                                        I took a fnudamental GD&T and CAD course in the Spring of 2018 from April to June. In this course, I was taught CAD
                                        in NX and used it to design a bracket for the final project. The bracket had to be designed to specific dimensioning
                                        and had to fail under a load betwenn 2000 and 2500 Newtons. Using CAD modeling, dimensioning a tolerancing, limits and
                                        fits, GD&T, simple manufacturing, statics, aterial selection, design for deflection and stiffness, etc, on a team, I
                                        designed and manufactured the bracket to the specefications of the project. I chose a U channel cross-section for the beam in
                                        compression for greater compressive strength and a simple bar shape for the beam in tension. The intention was for the
                                        compression beam to fail via buckling.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We built the bracket from sheet metal 1018 steel that was provided because it has a higher strength to mass ratio compared
                                        with the aluminum options. The completed bracket before test is shown in the image below. Notice the holding piece on the
                                        left side of the bracket is used to connect the compression test device to our design and places the load exactly where intended.
                                        The bracket failed during test at around 2050 Newtons with our design intendidng to fail at 2250 Newtons, one of just five in
                                        the class to fail within the design constraint. The buckled compression beam can be seen in the image on the right. The discrepancy in the amount of applied load at failure can be explained by the
                                        unreliable and imperfect manufacturing method of sheet metal bending, which leaves gaps in the beams and unevenly strains
                                        the material before test.
