                                    <p>
                                        In the Winter of 2019, from January to March, I took a product design course. In class, I, on a team of four, researched,
                                        designed, and tested a product with the intent of bringing it to market. The first few weeks were used to deside what market
                                        our product would be in. Our team researched the areas of Winter foot travel, medicine delivery, and mobile phone storage. We
                                        decided to pursue the latter because the other markets were very saturated with devices and did not have as much design space
                                        for new products. Moving forward in the phone storage direction, one of the things we recognized was that many women regularly
                                        did not have adequate pocket space to store their phone. We wanted to make a desireable, accessory phone holding pocket for
                                        women to wear as they pleased. It would be very secure to prevent loss and theft and could be customized or mathced to an
                                        outfit or style. Additionally, access to the phone would be no more difficult than taking a phone out of a pocket.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We went through several rounds of concept generation, prototyping, and user testing during the second part of the course. We
                                        experiemented with plastic cases, magnets, and even some metal designs. We finally came up with a fabric or leather case with
                                        a 3D printed clip to secure to waistbands. This was a very simple design, but that is what made it desireable and practical to
                                        users. In some ways, a phone case can say a lot about a person's style and personality, so our devicde needed to be modest and
                                        fit with our user's liftsyles. Our final design made from a blue leather is shown from the back in the image to the right and
                                        from the side in the image below.

                                    <p>
                                        This design was different than any of my other work because we were not given our project for the course. It was completely
                                        a topic of my team's choosing. Furthermore, it expanded my understanding of user-centered design and made me gain a new perspective
                                        on what is important to users and what makes something functional. I also learned new user observation and testing techniques as
                                        well as some sewing and fabric design work.
