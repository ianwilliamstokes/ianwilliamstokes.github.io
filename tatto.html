                                        <h2>Biomedical Tattoo Needles</h2>
                                    </header>
                            
                                    <p>
                                        I spent the Summer of 2019 from June to September working in Professor Carson Bruns' research lab at the University
                                        of Colorado in Boulder. I was drawn to his work because of his unique approach to biomedical and mechanical design
                                        through its combination with chemistry. Specifically, he has deisgned biomedical tattoo inks to help people in a vaariety
                                        of ways. Namely, he has worked on inks to assess heat and burn exposure, keep people warm longer in cold weather and cold
                                        longer in hot weather, tell when skin has experienced too much UV exposure. Future inks could include ones to read and display
                                        blood glucose level in tattoos and indicate when skins has been excosed to other forms of radiation. The work his lab has done
                                        on these inks is further explained in his TED talk. Beyond the design of his ink, Prof. Bruns' lab has also been working to
                                        develop a new method for adiminstering tattoos, which can allow the slightly larger particles of his inks permeate the skin.
                                        This new method was the focus of my Summer in his lab.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Basically, the novel method was designed similar to disolvable drug delivery needle pads where a pad of needles containing
                                        the ink would be pushed into the skin. After a few seconds, the needles would dissolve, releasing the ink into the dermis.
                                        When the pad is pulled away, all needles are gone, and the leftover trash is not a biohazard like traditional tattoo needles. 
                                        Beyond a method for administering biomedical ink, this process could be used as a simple, cheap method for traditional tattoos.
                                        Desiging and selling these tattoos is a startup Prof. Buns hopes to create in the future, and I do not have access to many
                                        images because of it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The basic process I developed for creating these needle beds involved initially designing needles on Solidworks. I then 3D printed
                                        them using a SLA printer in the lab. I then cast a mold for the dissolvable needles in PDMS plastic. This plastic is silocone based
                                        and very flexible. After creating molds, I cast the needles using a mixture of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and tattoo ink. PVP is a
                                        dissolvable, brittle plastic that is nontoxic once cured, so it is safe to be put in the human body. I put a glass backing on the needles
                                        with more PVP to be used to remove them from the mold and administer to skin. Once cured, I removed the PVP and ink needles from the
                                        PDMS mold. I desinged needles of a large variety of lengths, diameters, and shapes over the Summer to create those most effective
                                        for depositing ink in the skin. These needles were all tested in pig skin in lab. By the end of the Summer, I had developed the ideal
                                        needles for the job along with a perfect ratio of PVP and ink during casting. I had gotten the lab to the point where they could start
                                        testing their own inks in the process of desinging new patterns for traditional tattoos.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The first image to the right shows ink entering skin from one poke of a traditional tattoo needle. I used this to assess the depth
                                        ink needed to reach to perminantly tattoo skin for my needle desing. Additionally, I used this when doing some side calculation to determine
                                        the heat transfer between the body and the environment with the ink particles in the skin for a new ink being developed in our lab desinged to
                                        maintain consistent body temperature in changing environment temperature. The second image on the right shows a PDMS mold under miscroscope
                                        created in the disolvable needle process described above. Notice this is an early, imperfect mold since the damage in the top right corner
                                        was a result of an innaccurate ratio of monomers to create PDMS. The image below shows a more perfect final mold.
                                    </p>

                                        Overall, this experience gave me tangible knowledge in new 3D printing methods, plastics manufacturing, chemistry and ink design, lab testing
                                        iterative process, and CAD modeling among other things.
