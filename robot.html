                                        <h2>Autonomous Robot Competition</h2>
                                    </header>
                            
                                    <p>
                                        In the Spring of 2019, I participated in the Northwestern University Autonomous Robotics Competition on a team with two others.
                                        The prompt for the projec t required us to build a robot to be controlled by our team that could sense and collect tokens in random
                                        locations on a game board without our teams being able to see the robot or the board. Each of four tokens needed to be collected and removed
                                        from the board before another team's robot did the same in a head to head competition. The tokens were covered in reflective tape and were of
                                        a variety of sizes from above, specifically 2x2 inches, 2x4, 2x6, and 2x8. There were holes in the tops of the tokens at 2 inch intervals.
                                        These holes were intended to be used by our robots to collect and remove the tokens.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The strategy we used for the competition involved solving several robotics problems:
                                        being able to determine where the robot is on the game board, sensing barriers and
                                        tokens on the game board, navigating the game board, and collecting and disposing of
                                        tokens.
                                        For determining where the robot is on the game board and sensing barriers and tokens,
                                        we used the simplest setup of sensors possible. We wanted to do three things:
                                        determine where the robot is in space using vive sensors for positioning, sense objects
                                        in front of the robot using the time of flight sensor, and determine whether the object is a
                                        token or a barrier using a laser and phototransistor setup. The circuit design for the hardware is shown in the first image on the right.
                                        Our strategy for navigating the game board involved the shape and driving mechanism
                                        of our robot. We wanted to make the robot as compact as possible so it would fit
                                        between and into the corners of the barriers. To do this, we made the robot 7”x7”. We
                                        then drove the robot with differential drive from two motors and a ball bearing dummy
                                        wheel used for stability.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the collection of tokens, a claw design that made use of the holes in the tops of the
                                        tokens was used. It is shown in the second image on the right. The robot was also designed
                                        to be level to the ground and have a low
                                        center of gravity to make the grabbing of the tokens easier. 
                                        The claw was the most involved aspect of our mechanical design and what I cfocused most of my time on.
                                        We wanted it to work on any size token, with the token being placed anywhere on the game board, and with
                                        the robot approaching the token at any angle. To do this, we focused on grabbing the
                                        holes on top of the tokens because every size token had the same size holes. The
                                        design we came up with was similar to a pin impression children’s toy with many plastic
                                        robs that can be pressed up through a board of holes.
                                        The design we came up with used only three pins that could be pressed upwards but
                                        held down with springs. This is shown in the third image on the right. They were spaced out just enough so that only one pin would
                                        go into the hole in the token while the others were pressed upwards. This gave us a
                                        much higher chance of hitting a hole in the token than with one pin. The final claw
                                        design with two of its pins being pressed up with one down is shown in the figure below.
                                        The arm of the claw was then designed to be long enough to reach into the corner of a
                                        barrier to grab a token. A servo was used to operate this claw and was positioned on
                                        the top level of the robot chassis. This was done such that as the claw came down to
                                        grab a token, the rods would be exactly perpendicular to the game board table when
                                        they came into contact with the token holes. This was to ensure that the rods would not
                                        come in at an angle to the holes, reducing the chance of grabbing the token.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Th final robot is shown in the image below. I learned a great deal about robotics desing for this project along
                                        woth laser cutting skills for the chassis manufacturing and 3D printing for the wheels and servo mount. Programming
                                        the robot and wiring the sensors were also new skills that I had to develop for the competition.
                                    </p>
