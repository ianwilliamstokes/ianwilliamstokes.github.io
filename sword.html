                                        <h2>Injection Molded Toy Sword</h2>
                                    </header>
                            
                                    <p>
                                        In the Winter of 2019, I, on a team of three, was tasked with designing and manufacturing an injection molded 
                                        toy based on a local fourth grader's drawing. We designed a three part, snap-fit Water Psychic Secret Sword CAD 
                                        model in NX (Unigraphics), designed a two aluminum molds based on the parts, and developed the CAM process for 
                                        machining the molds. We then machined the molds using a Haas Minimill CNC machine before injection molding 100 
                                        polypropylene models of the sword. Finally, we complete the project by conducting a series of tests on the 
                                        individual parts and fully assembled toy to assess sizing accuracy using go no-go charts and quality assurance 
                                        practices.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For the design of the sword, we had to adapt our manufacturing method to meet the design requirements, while 
                                        remaining within the bounds of our shop's capabilities. Specifically, the blade of the sword was extremely long and thin, 
                                        which made the mold very difficult to machine with a smallest tool size of 1/16". The hilt of the sword was divided 
                                        into two halves with a snap fit connection, a requirement of the project. The general design was based on traditional 
                                        "lobster" style swords from Scandinavia. The connection between the two halves was two 1/16" pins with a locational 
                                        interference fit of H7p6.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This project earned me tangible skills in CAD and CAM development as well as metals CNC machining and plastics 
                                        manufacturing. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The fourth grader's drawing, engineering drawings of the CAD parts, and some images of 
                                        the final injection molded swords are shown in the images to the right.
