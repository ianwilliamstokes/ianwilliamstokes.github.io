                                        <h2>Sink Accessibility Device</h2>

                                    <p>
                                        In my first quarter of Design Thinking and Communication (DTC), from September to December of 2016, I worked as the
                                        project manager on a small team to design a device for the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. DTC is an engineering design
                                        course intended to give first year engineers an oportunity to complete a design projects for a real client. We were
                                        tasked with making the Stingray touch exhibit accessible to users in wheelchairs, while gaining valuable industry
                                        knowledge, ADA complience experience, technical communication skills, and shop and manufacturing training.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Shedd's exhibit requires users to wash their hands before and after touching the stingrays in a tank. Unfortunately,
                                        the outdoor sinks they have onsight, though very sanitary and portable, are not easy for people in wheelchairs to access.
                                        The original sink design is shown in the first picture on the right. Notice the key issue here is that the sink
                                        can only be turned on by stepping on the black ring around the bottom. For this reason, we designed a divice that
                                        allows a person in a wheelchair to activate the water in sink.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our design process consisted of sight visits, background research, competetive product research, brainstorming sessions
                                        concept generation, prototype development, user testing, prototype iteration, and a final product based on all our previous
                                        work. During this whole process, I was responsible for communicating biweekly updates to the client. Our final design can
                                        be seen in the second image on the right. The user can activate the water by rolling the front wheel of a wheelchair onto
                                        the clearly marked ADA certifiable level. This action pulls a cable, which is redirected through a puller box (shown in the
                                        third image on the right), that activates the water from the sink internally. A wheelchair demonstraighting this is shown in the image below.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our final design review consisted of a poster presentation to a set of judges. This poster is shown in the last image on the
                                        right. The judges awarded our team the DTC Communication Award (one of just two awards given) over the other first year teams.
                                        Our device was then given to the Shedd and installed in their exhibit for users. As my first engineering design project, this
                                        experience chiefly gave me valuable understanding of the user-centered design process and methods for working professionally
                                        and effectively with a client.
